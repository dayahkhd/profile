Introduction

Hello, ðŸ‘‹! My name is Hidayah from Johor Bahru, Malaysia. Graduating in September 2021 from University of Technology Malaysia, UTM, in Bachelor of Computer Science (Software Engineering) I am looking for a job in this field and intersted in web development and UI/UX designing. Eventhough I have attended many courses back in university, I feel like I need to learn more in coding to improve the skill that I have because I don't graduate with a good pointer and I'm very aware of that. If you have read up until here, thank you and let's do our best in anything we do. 
If you have anything to share, feel free to reach me through nurhidayah9707@gmail.com. Bye!
